A chronological log of updates and improvements to LangChain Python.

<Update label="v1.1" description="November 25th, 2025">

* [Model profiles](/oss/python/langchain/models#model-profiles): Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a `.profile` attribute. These data are derived from [models.dev](https://github.com/sst/models.dev), an open source project providing model capability data.
* [Summarization middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#summarization): Updated to support flexible trigger points using model profiles for context-aware summarization.
* [Structured output](/oss/python/langchain/structured-output): `ProviderStrategy` support (native structured output) can now be inferred from model profiles.
* [`SystemMessage` for `create_agent`](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/custom#working-with-system-messages): Support for passing `SystemMessage` instances directly to `create_agent`'s `system_prompt` parameter, enabling advanced features like cache control and structured content blocks.
* [Model retry middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#model-retry): New middleware for automatically retrying failed model calls with configurable exponential backoff.
* [Content moderation middleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware/built-in#content-moderation): OpenAI content moderation middleware for detecting and handling unsafe content in agent interactions. Supports checking user input, model output, and tool results.
